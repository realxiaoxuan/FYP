    "## Assignment 1: Constraint Satisfaction Search\n",
    "\n",
    "@Authors: **Wayne Wobcke, Alfred Krzywicki, Stefano Mezza**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Due Date:** Week 5, Friday, October 11, 5.00pm\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment concerns developing optimal solutions to a scheduling problem inspired by the scenario of hosting a number of visitors to an organization such as a university department. Each visitor must have a number of meetings, however there are both *constraints* on availability (of rooms and hosts), and *preferences* of each visitor for the days and times of each meeting. Some of the constraints are “hard” constraints (cannot be violated in any solution), while the preferences are “soft” constraints (can be satisfied to more or less degree). Each soft constraint has a cost function giving the “penalty” for scheduling the meeting at a given time (*lower* costs are preferred). The aim is to schedule all the required meetings so that the sum total of all the penalties is *minimized*, and all the constraints are satisfied.\n",
    "\n",
    "More technically, this assignment is an example of a *constraint optimization problem*, a problem that has constraints like a standard Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP), but also *costs* associated with each solution. For this assignment, we will use a *greedy* algorithm to find optimal solutions to visitor hosting problems that are specified as text strings. However, unlike the greedy search algorithm described in the lectures on search, this greedy algorithm has the property that it is guaranteed to find an optimal solution for any problem (if a solution exists).\n",
    "\n",
    "The assignment will use the AIPython code of Poole & Mackworth. You are given code to translate visitor hosting problems specified as text strings into CSPs with a cost, and you are given code for several constraint solving algorithms &ndash; based on domain splitting and arc consistency, and based on depth-first search. The assignment will be to implement some missing procedures and to analyse the performance of the constraint solving methods, both analytically and experimentally.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Submission Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "- This is an individual assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Submit **this** Jupyter notebook on the CSE give system (or vlab) using the following command: **give cs9414 ass1 ass1.ipynb**\n",
    "\n",
    "- This means that the Jupyter notebook file **must** be called ``ass1.ipynb``.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Make sure you set up AIPython (as done below) so the code can be run on either CSE machines or a marker's own machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Do not submit any AIPython code. Hence do not change any AIPython code to make your code run.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Make sure your notebook runs cleanly (restart the kernel and run each cell to check).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Do not modify the existing code in this notebook except to answer the questions. Marks will be given as and where indicated.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you want to submit additional code (e.g. for generating plots), add that at the end of the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Do not distribute any of this code on the Internet.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Late Penalties\n",
    "\n",
    "Standard UNSW late penalties apply.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Plagiarism\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that ALL work submitted for this assignment must be your own work and no sharing or copying of code or answers is allowed. You may discuss the assignment with other students but must not collaborate on developing answers to the questions. You may use code from the Internet only with suitable attribution of the source. You may not use ChatGPT or any similar software to generate any part of your explanations, evaluations or code. Do not use public code repositories on sites such as github or file sharing sites such as Google Drive to save any part of your work &ndash; make sure your code repository or cloud storage is private and do not share any links. This also applies after you have finished the course, as we do not want next year’s students accessing your solution, and plagiarism penalties can still apply after the course has finished.\n",
    "\n",
    "All submitted assignments will be run through plagiarism detection software to detect similarities to other submissions, including from past years. You should **carefully** read the UNSW policy on academic integrity and plagiarism (linked from the course web page), noting, in particular, that collusion (working together on an assignment, or sharing parts of assignment solutions) is a form of plagiarism.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, do not use any contract cheating “academies” or online “tutoring” services. This counts as serious misconduct with heavy penalties up to automatic failure of the course with 0 marks, and expulsion from the university for repeat offenders."

    "### The Visitor Hosting Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "A CSP for this assignment is a set of variables representing meetings, binary constraints on pairs of meetings, and unary constraints (hard or soft) on meetings. The domains are all working hours in one week, and meetings are all assumed to be 1 hour duration. Days are represented (in the input and output) as strings ‘mon’, ‘tue’, ‘wed’, ‘thu’ and ‘fri’, and times are represented as strings ‘9am’, ‘10am’, ‘11am’, ‘12pm’, ‘1pm’, ‘2pm’, ‘3pm’ and ‘4pm’. The only possible values are a combination of a day and time, e.g. ‘mon 9am’. Each meeting name is a string (with no spaces), and each constraint is hard or soft.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three types of constraint:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Binary Constraints:** These specify a hard requirement for the relationship between two meetings.\n",
    "- **Hard Domain Constraints:** These specify hard requirements for the meetings themselves.\n",
    "- **Soft Domain Constraints:** These constraints are non-critical requirements for a meeting that represent preferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each soft constraint has a function defining the *cost* associated with violating the preference, that the constraint solver must minimize, while respecting all the hard constraints. The *cost* of a solution is simply the sum of the costs for the soft constraints that the solution violates (and is always a non-negative integer).\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the list of possible constraints for a visitor hosting problem (comments below are for explanation and do **not** appear in the input specification; however, the code we supply *should* work with comments that take up a full line): \n",
